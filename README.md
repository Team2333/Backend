# Backend code for covid-polygraph.

![ci](https://github.com/Team2333/Backend/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

## How to use
To run the code, use Docker:
```bash
docker build . -t covid-polygraph:latest
```
Afterwards, you can start the backend locally using the docker image built. For our team, we deploy this image onto our remote server for api access.
